        <p class="text2">The Acorn’s Whisper

          In the heart of Whispering Woods, where leaves rustled secrets and sunlight danced through the canopy, lived a squirrel named Hazel. Hazel was no ordinary squirrel; her fur shimmered like autumn leaves, and her eyes held the sparkle of forgotten dreams.
          One crisp morning, as dew clung to spiderwebs, Hazel scampered along the moss-covered path. Her tiny paws sought acorns—the currency of squirrel joy. But today, she yearned for more than mere sustenance. She longed for wonder.
          And wonder found her.

          Beneath an ancient oak, Hazel spotted an acorn unlike any other. Its shell bore intricate patterns—a celestial map etched by moonbeams. When she touched it, warmth spread through her veins, and the forest whispered secrets.
          “Seek the heart of joy,” the wind murmured. “Plant this acorn where your laughter echoes.”
          Hazel’s heart fluttered. She carried the acorn to the sun-kissed glade, where dandelions swayed in rhythm with her dreams. With reverence, she buried it in the soft earth.
